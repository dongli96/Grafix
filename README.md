# Grafix
Grafix is a Python library of construction and operation of graphs. It warps APIs from the C++ low-level library `graph.cpp`.

`graph.cpp` is compiled as a Python dynamic-link library (DLL) `graph.cp39-win_amd64.pyd` using pybind11 and cmake.

To use grafix, you have to install graphviz:

```
pip install graphviz
```
